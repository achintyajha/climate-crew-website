## Primitive Interpretation of climate

Our story of climate starts with the primitive interpretations of climate ie. an assortment of mythologies belonging to different cultures.
While, now we can find out the weather forecast with just one click, something so seemingly ‘simple’ in our modern age, was considered to be a true wonder in our ancient past. The most plausible explanation of these wonderous anomalies or what we now call thunder or rain, was – Gods.
