    Our aim is to take you through a visual journey, where you will explore the climatic evolution of our home planet, Earth.

    This project is aimed at providing a digital historical perspective on primitive as well as scientific research on greenhouse and glaciation period. These two aspects of our climate can be investigated separately but works of naturalists, geologists, physicists and chemists have made it easier to understand them jointly.
    In today's world, satellites with precise measuring equipment have not only enabled us to get information about our climate but also predict climatic changes.
